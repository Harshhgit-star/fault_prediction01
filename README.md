# fault_prediction01
 Problem Statement
Modern power distribution systems require rapid and accurate fault detection to maintain grid stability and prevent large-scale outages. Faults like line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults can disrupt electricity supply and cause significant economic losses if not identified quickly.

The challenge is to design a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying these faults using electrical measurement data (voltage & current phasors).

Dataset: Kaggle - Power System Faults Dataset
Proposed Solution
A machine learning-based fault detection system, developed and deployed on IBM Cloud Lite, that:

Analyzes voltage and current data

Classifies fault types (Line-to-Ground, Line-to-Line, Three-Phase)

Differentiates between normal and faulty operating conditions

Enables real-time fault detection for improving grid reliability
Technologies Used
IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (Model development & deployment)

IBM Cloud Lite (Cloud platform)

IBM Cloud Object Storage (Dataset storage & access)

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook (Model training & testing)

Machine Learning (Supervised Classification Models)
